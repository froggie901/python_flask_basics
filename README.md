A Basic Tutorial on How to Build a Website with Flask

### page_1.py
This is basic python using some basic tools in Flask

1. If you have not used Flask before you need to install it via the terminal `pip install flask` should do the trick 
2. Open your IDE of choice, I like using either ATOM or VSCode

`from flask import Flask, render_template` is the only import you will need for this simple website. 

If you are new to website development like I am, you are going to see some unfamiliar variable and symbols. Let's review them! 

- `__name__` is a special variable in Python, it will evaluate to the name of the current module. More on this later, but it will essentially check to see if the file is being called from another script. [EXAMPLE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/__name__-special-variable-python/)  

- `@app.route()` First, the little @-symbol serves as a decorator for the file app method inside flask. It basically serves as a pointer for information or data.
